# Snippets
Bob Gradeck Weekly Snippets

This is where I publish snippets of my weekly priorities and accomplishments. I'll do this the first and last day of the week.

I'm doing this each week. I'm hoping this helps me manage my time, and communicate to project collaborators and other partners what I'm actually doing. 

I learned about snippets from 18f https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/17/snippets/
